# Plant-Growth-Data-Classification
This repository focuses on predicting plant growth milestones based on various environmental and management factors using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes features like soil type, sunlight hours, water frequency, fertilizer type, temperature, and humidity, which influence plant development.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features:
Dataset Exploration: Loading, summarizing, and visualizing the dataset
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, duplicate records, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of categorical and numerical variables, correlation analysis
Feature Selection & Engineering: Identifying key predictors for plant growth milestones
Model Training & Evaluation: Comparing Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN, and Logistic Regression
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the best-performing model using Grid Search CV
ðŸš€ Technologies Used:
Pandas, NumPy â€“ Data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn â€“ Data visualization
Scikit-Learn â€“ Machine learning algorithms, model training, and evaluation
ðŸ“‚ Contents:
